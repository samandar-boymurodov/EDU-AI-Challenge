Based on your requirements—a social platform with millions of users, mostly read traffic (80% reads vs. 20% writes), and the need to store profiles, posts and the “who‑knows‑who” graph at scale—here’s how you might think about your choice:

---

## 1. Data models and query patterns

| Domain          | Data shape            | Typical queries                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Profiles**    | Relational / document | Fetch a user by ID, filter by attributes              |
| **Posts**       | Document              | Read a user’s feed (paginated), full‑text search      |
| **Connections** | Graph                 | “Friends of friends”, mutual connections, suggestions |

---

## 2. Core requirements

1. **High read throughput**
   – 80% of operations are reads (profiles, timelines, feed queries)
   – Low‑latency lookups, paging and ranking

2. **Scalability**
   – Millions of users → billions of documents
   – Growing connections graph

3. **Polyglot needs**
   – Document‑style queries for posts/profiles
   – Graph traversals for social connections

---

## 3. Recommended Architecture: Polyglot Persistence

1. **Primary user‑ and post‑store (Document / Wide‑Column)**

   * **Apache Cassandra** or **Amazon DynamoDB**

     * **Why?** Linearly scalable write and read throughput, tunable consistency, built‑in sharding.
     * Stores profiles and posts as JSON‑style records, with time‑series partitioning for feeds.
     * Excellent at high write volumes and fast range scans for paged feeds.

2. **Social graph layer (Graph Database)**

   * **Neo4j** (self‑hosted / Aura) or **Amazon Neptune**

     * **Why?** Native graph traversals (e.g. friends‑of‑friends), recommendations, shortest‑path queries.
     * Scales to billions of edges (with appropriate clustering).

3. **Caching / Read‑optimization**

   * **Redis** (Cluster mode)

     * Cache hot profiles, pre‑computed feeds or newsfeeds, sessions.
     * Pub/sub or streams to invalidate/update caches on writes.

4. **Search & Analytics**

   * **Elasticsearch**

     * Full‑text search over posts, filtering by tags, trending topics, geolocation queries.

---

## 4. Example Data Flow

1. **Write path**

   * User posts → write‑through Cassandra/DynamoDB
   * Event triggers:

     * Graph update (add new “follows” edge in Neo4j/Neptune)
     * Invalidate or update Redis cache for affected user feeds

2. **Read path**

   1. Check Redis cache for feed/profile
   2. Miss → read from Cassandra/DynamoDB
   3. For graph‑heavy queries (e.g. “people you may know”), query Neo4j/Neptune
   4. Return assembled response

---

## 5. Alternative: Multi‑Model DB

If you prefer fewer moving parts, consider a **multi‑model** system like:

* **ArangoDB**
* **OrientDB**
* **Couchbase**

They support document + graph queries in a single engine, simplify operations, and still scale out—though you may trade off some of the sheer throughput and maturity of purpose‑built systems.

---

### Final suggestion

* **At scale** (millions→tens of millions of users):

  * **Cassandra** (or DynamoDB) for profiles/posts
  * **Neo4j** (or Neptune) for connections
  * **Redis** for caching
  * **Elasticsearch** for search

* **For faster development / fewer components**:

  * **ArangoDB** or **Couchbase** as a single multi‑model store

This polyglot or multi‑model approach gives you the best of high‑speed reads, horizontal scalability, and rich graph querying for your social‑network use case.
