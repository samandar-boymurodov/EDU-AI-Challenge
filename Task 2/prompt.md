I came across a bug on our project where the logout button on the Safari browser doesn't work - it doesn't do any action when clicked.

I need to create a well-structured ticket that accurately describes the bug.

The ticket structure should be as follows:

- Title
- Description
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected vs Actual Behavior
- Environment (if known)
- Severity or Impact
