I need your help to pick a suitable database for my needs.

I have a social project with millions of users. We store profiles, posts, and connections between users. Key criteria for a database:
- High data read speed. Because 80% of operations are read-only and 20% are write-only.
- Scalability as the user base grows

Analyze my requirements and suggest a suitable type of database.
